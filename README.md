# MentalAI
This is an AI chatbot i created based off Neural Nine video of the same topic. In this repository it will only include the training and the model file as i finish setting up the intents.json file. The premise of this AI is to be more of a mental health assistant AI that someone can talk to and ask it questions about mental health. As i set up the intents im doing research into looking at types of mental health questions and responses.
